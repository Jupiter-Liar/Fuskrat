# Fuskrat
A Manifest V3 fusking extension for Google Chrome
##
Firefox used to have some quite good fusking extensions. They made viewing whole galleries a lot easier. But as of this writing, Google Chrome has very few options. So I've made one.

To use this extension, simply find an image you'd like to fusk, right click, and choose "Fusk...", and a popup div will appear on top of the webpage. Select the part of the URL you want to fusk, type in a number range, and press a button, and the gallery will generate. You can fusk in a new tab, or fusk right there in the popup div. It even supports hex numbers.

Please use responsibly.
